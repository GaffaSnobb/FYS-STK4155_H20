## FYS-STK4155 project 1 - Regression analysis and resampling methods
### Code structure
Parameters for each part of the project is located in an individual .py file, named part_x.py (x = a, b, c, d, e, g). Simply run each file by

```
python part_x.py
```

Note that the runtime is somewhat long for some of the programs, since all experiments are repeated and averaged. If you wish to use less time (but get worse data), please edit the desired file and change the ```repetitions``` parameter.


### Report
The report is located in /doc, and all figures for the report is located in /fig.

### Compatibility
All code is programmed in Python 3.8.5. Earlier versions will probably work fine, but we guarantee full compatibility only with 3.8.5.
